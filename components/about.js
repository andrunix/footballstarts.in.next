        <h2>About footballstarts.in...</h2>
        <p>
          How many times have you wanted to know how long you have to wait to watch some 
          college football? Every day right? Now you can bookmark this site to know how 
          many days until the first game of the season!
        </p>
        <p>
          What is really cool is that you can also easily view how many days until your 
          favorite team's first game. For example, http://clemson.footballstarts.in will 
          show you how many games until the next game for the Tigers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, you can use http://tigers.footballstarts.in to get to that same 
          page. We are also in the midst of adding other aliases for teams as well. For 
          example, for Tennessee, you could use, Volunteers, Vols, or UT to get to 
          http://tennessee.footballstarts.in.
